This repository will be used for IB Computer Science Class 2018-2019.  In it, all files made through the class will be stored.

My goals for Computer Science this year:
  1. Learn basic syntax in Java
  2. Discover and program useful algorithms, weighing their pros and cons
  3. Develop computational thinking skills
  4. Have fun!
